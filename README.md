## Code of Conduct
1. No disrespectful behavior. This includes threats, harassment, stalking, abuse, slurs, profanity, personal attacks, sexual remarks or innuendos, physical violence, public speculation about others, and any other behavior that you would not tolerate others display towards you.

2. Respect the presenter and other attendees · Refrain from carrying on conversations during the presentation. If conversation is necessary, please leave the presentation room

	- Ask questions but respect the presenter’s wishes regarding when to ask questions (some like questions during the presentation, others have specific Q&A time slots). Also, give others a chance to ask questions. If you have more than one question, give others a chance to pose theirs before you ask your next question.

	- Don’t challenge the presenter on a point during the presentation. If you feel that the presenter’s information is completely incorrect or off base, signal one of the user group leaders, leave the room to present your information, and allow the user group leader to deal with it. Asking a question that might lead to clarification is one thing, directly disagreeing with the presenter leads to embarrassment of the presenter and confusion for other attendees.

	- Avoid asking questions or making statements that will side-track the presentation. However it’s intended, it may be seen as hijacking the presentation.
